        <p>This project started as your typical <i>I know, i'll try and make my guitar hero controller wireless...</i>
            that soon grew to displays, dynamic lighting, wifi, embedded web server, etc.etc.etc. blah blah blah.</p>

        <p>And background shaders in the web pages.</p>

        <p>Because.... reasons :)</p>

        <p>The actual end goal is a decently re-usable re-targettable general purpose game controller firmware
            that can, with a bit of electronic jiggery-pokery, be used for most game controllers you could want to
            make or adapt.</p>

        <p>Will have to see where this goes...</p>

        <h1>Thanks</h1>

        <p>Especial thanks go to the following projects and subsequent authors who provided frameworks and
            libraries that made this project possible:</p>
