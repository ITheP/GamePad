// To do list
// ExternalLED_FastLEDCount - create a run time variant of this, with corresponding FastLED stuff to be able to toggle at run time counts e.g. between full ExternalLED_Count and 1
// i.e. battery saving mode to turn on/off led's e.g. if battery below certain percentage, or user preference

// NOTE that button holding measurements and LED measurements might cross the micros() boundary and not be accurate - so update with more detailed timing measurements
